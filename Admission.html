<p>  
The selection of students into the college is based on the following criteria: </p>

<ul>

<li>An entrance examination. Candidates will be tested in English Language, Mathematics and General paper </li>

<li>Children must be ten (10) years of age to be admitted into Year 7 except in highly exceptional cases. </li>

</ul>

<p>After administration of the test, successful candidates are offered admission and will be issued an admission letter.</p>



<p> Admission remains provisional until the 
non-refundable deposit fee,   which confirms acceptance of offer is 
paid. On payment of the deposit,   the school issues the prospectus, 
which gives a more detailed overview   of the school including boarding 
requirements for intending boarders.   The school's code of conduct, 
list of books, and school calendar will be   made available on full 
payment of fees. To ensure proper planning, the   school requests that 
the school fees be paid in full by the deadline.   Failure to meet the 
deadline will lead to forfeiture of reservation to   candidates on the 
waiting list. </p>

<h3>For uk enquiries, call 07737599787 or 07738906602</h3>

<p>Admission is neither restricted to nor automatic 
for pupils from   Juniors International Primary School (the junior arm 
of the college). </p>

<h3>School Fees  </h3>

<p>The fee is affordable and expected to be paid 
termly or annually by   stipulated deadlines. All fees should be paid by
teller or bank draft to   the School Account at the designated Banks. 
No part payments are   allowed in the school. Fees could be paid at any 
of the Bank's branches   nationwide. Provision has also been made for 
students whose parents are   resident abroad and will like to pay at 
their base. Please find out   details from the school. First term fees 
are usually higher because of   Exercise Books, Uniforms, House Wears, 
Sports Wears, Cardigans, etc that   will be supplied. </p>

<h3>Promotion and Subject Selection</h3>

<p>Year  9 â€“ 10 as specified in the National Policy 
for Education,   students are expected to pass the following subjects at
credit level to   qualify for selection into the Science Class:-English
language,   Mathematics and Integrated/Basic Science. Arts or Social 
Science   Class:-English Language, Mathematics and Social Studies. </p>

<h3>Resumption</h3>

<p>All students both old and new (day and boarders) 
are expected to   report at the office on arrival (on resumption) where 
the Principal, the   House Parents or the Classroom Tutor will formally 
receive them as the   case may be. Any student found in the school 
without proper clearance   and entry permit from the college authorities
will be regarded as an   offender. Parents of boarders are permitted in
the hostel only on the   first day of resumption to help the child 
settle in. No parent will be   allowed in school after 6.00 p.m. on such
days. No student will also be   received after 6.00 p.m. as the school 
gates will be locked. </p>

<h3>Withdrawal</h3>

<p>A term's notice in writing is required. In the 
light of this, a   deposit of Twenty Thousand Naira(N20, 000.00) is to 
be paid when parents   come to settle a new intake (whether day or 
boarding on resumption).   The deposit is forfeited if the condition for
withdrawal is not adhered   to. This is to allow candidates on the 
waiting list to be informed and   have the anticipated space filled up. </p>
